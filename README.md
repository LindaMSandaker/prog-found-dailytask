-Console log 3 multiplied by 6
-Using the alert() method, alert your name, e.g. alert(“Marie”);

1-2:
Write the following in a script.js file linked to from an index.html page. Add a comment above each line and console log each variable you create.
-Create a variable called animal and assign it the string value “frog”.
-Create a variable called delivered and assign it the boolean value true.
-Create a variable called score and assign it the number value 12.
-Create a variable called fullName and assign it the result of joining th string values “John” and “Smith”.
-Use the "typeof" operator to find out the type of the fullName variable. Assign the result to a variable called nameType.

1-3:
Given the following variable declaration var age = 10; write an if-else statement that checks if age is greater than or equal to 7. If it is, console log the string “Greater than or equal to 7”. If it is not, console log the string “Less than 7”.
Given the following variable declaration var animal = “cat”; write an if-else-if-if statement that checks the value of animal.
Check if animal is equal to “parrot”. If it is, console log the string “The animal has two legs”.
Check if animal is equal to “cat”. If it is, console log the string “The animal has four legs”.
If animal is neither “parrot” nor “cat”, console log the string “The animal has an unknown amount of legs”. Check your code by changing the value of the animal variable.

Write a for loop that logs a number from 1 to 5
Write a for loop that logs a number from 7 to 16
Given this array var animals = [“dog”, “cat”, “frog”]; use a for loop to console log each animal in the array.

What is the difference between the == comparison operator and the === comparison operator?
What would this comparison check return: “6” === 6
What would this comparison check return: “6” == 6
What is the difference between the != comparison operator and the !== comparison operator?
What would this comparison check return: “4” !== 4
What would this comparison check return: “4” != 4
Give this variable declaration var someVar; what would this check return: typeOf(someVar);

True or false: arrays in JavaScript can hold different types of values.
How do we determine the number of items in an array; which property can we use?
Declare a variable called animals and assign it an empty array as an initial value.
Add the string values “cow”, “bird” and “mouse” to the animals array using the push method.
Use a for loop to console log every value in the animals array.

2:3
Create an array called people.
Inside this array add two objects each containing two properties, name and age.
Give each property and a value with an appropriate type, i.e. a string value for name and a number value for age.
Use a for loop to log the name property of each object in the array.

2:4
Create a function called printName.
Give the function one argument called name.
Inside the function console log the name argument.
Call the function and pass your name in as an argument.
Create a function called returnName that accepts one argument called name.
Inside the function add the string “Hello “ to the argument and return it.
Call the function, pass in your name as the argument and assign the return value to a variable.
Console log the variable. It should log, for example, “Hello John”.
